# Object-Detection--Coco-Name-s-Classes
This project helps in detecting the objects recorded by the camera, serving the purpose of object detection.

Library used - OpenCV

The project works on the fundamental of image processing for which we use OpenCV.
The 91 classes under Coco Names mark the different subsets of objects that are detected when an object is exposed under the vision of the connnected camera.
The othe two flied (.pdtxt, .pb) are used to set the scale and setup of the object detection processes, ehile including the details of the coco names classes.
